      <description>When setting up pleroma for my activity-pub instance I was a bit over-zealous and selected the option &amp;ldquo;Enable RUM index&amp;rdquo; without knowing what it means.
As this is a single user instance using RUM indices is really not neccessary, also I found out that they are quite heavy in disk usage, blowing up the db by several GB. I also found out that creating these indices takes a very long time when I upgraded to a newer PostgreSQL version and had to import the dump file.</description>
