      <title>Separate Media Domain for Akkoma</title>

      <description>The last release of Akkoma finally enforces setting a base_url value for the uploader (guess who didn&amp;rsquo;t read the release notes before upgrading and had to start digging after the service refused to start).
To enable akkoma to start again I set the base_url value to the main domain of my akkoma instance but this still leaves a rather stern warning to switch to another domain for uplaods (and the media proxy if you use it).</description>

      <title>Pleroma: Remove Rum Index</title>

      <description>When setting up pleroma for my activity-pub instance I was a bit over-zealous and selected the option &amp;ldquo;Enable RUM index&amp;rdquo; without knowing what it means.
As this is a single user instance using RUM indices is really not neccessary, also I found out that they are quite heavy in disk usage, blowing up the db by several GB. I also found out that creating these indices takes a very long time when I upgraded to a newer PostgreSQL version and had to import the dump file.</description>
